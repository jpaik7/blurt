# blurt
Real-time chat servce using websockets that responds to user engagement by analyzing text chat sentiment and generating a pictorial history of the chat using Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks (AttnGAN). 

Developed as part of my final project for the [Creative Applications of ML](http://courses.channel.studio/spring2019machinelearning/) class at [RISD](https://www.risd.edu/). 

Blurt uses a new (and really cool) tool called Runway ML for getting quick and easy access to state of the art machine learning models in real time. In order to try it out (and to have a fully reproducible version of this program), take a look and download Runway ML [here](https://runwayml.com/).
